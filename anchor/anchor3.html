    <h3>Section-1</h3>
    <p>Plastic is a non-biodegradable material. It does not mix with soil and reduces soil fertility. It cannot be automatically recycled and harms the Earths life cycle. However, plastic is replacing the traditional use of jute, cotton or paper materials and is becoming a threat to the living world. Children run the risk of suffocation when playing with plastic bags. Coloured plastic carry-bags cause food poisoning. Plastic waste, if not disposed of carefully, often clogs sewage systems.</p>
